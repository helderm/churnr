 abstract = {Customer temporal behavioral data was represented as images in order to perform churn prediction by leveraging deep learning architectures prominent in image classification. Supervised  learning was performed on labeled data of over 6 million customers using deep convolutional neural networks, which achieved an AUC of 0.743 on the test dataset using no more than 12 temporal        features for each customer. Unsupervised learning was conducted using autoencoders to better understand the reasons for customer churn. Images that maximally activate the hidden units of an         autoencoder trained with churned customers reveal ample opportunities for action to be taken to prevent churn among strong data, no voice users.},

 @article{Tax2016,
 abstract = {Predictive business process monitoring methods exploit logs of completed cases of a process in order to make predictions about running cases thereof. Existing methods in this space are  tailor-made for specific prediction tasks. Moreover, their relative accuracy is highly sensitive to the dataset at hand, thus requiring users to engage in trial-and-error and tuning when applying   them in a specific setting. This paper investigates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as an approach to build consistently accurate models for a wide range of predictive process         monitoring tasks. First, we show that LSTMs outperform existing techniques to predict the next event of a running case and its timestamp. Next, we show how to use models for predicting the next     task in order to predict the full continuation of a running case. Finally, we apply the same approach to predict the remaining time, and show that this approach outperforms existing tailor-made     methods.},

@article{Runge2014,
 abstract = {Predicting when players will leave a game creates a unique opportunity to increase players' lifetime and revenue contribution. Players can be incentivized to stay, strategically cross-  linked to other games in the company's portfolio or, as a last resort, be passed on to other companies through in-game advertisement. This paper focuses on predicting churn for highvalue players    of casual social games and attempts to assess the business impact that can be derived from a predictive churn model. We compare the prediction performance of four common classification algorithms   over two casual social games, each with millions of players. Furthermore, we implement a hidden Markov model to explicitly address temporal dynamics. We find that a neural network achieves the      best prediction performance in terms of area under curve (AUC). In addition, to assess the business value of churn prediction, we design and implement an A/B test on one of the games, using free    in-game currency as an incentive to retain players. Test results indicate that contacting players shortly before the predicted churn event substantially improves the effectiveness of communication  with players. They further show that giving out free in-game currency does not significantly impact the churn rate or monetization of players. This suggests that players can only be retained by     remarkably changing their gameplay experience ahead of the churn event and that cross-linking may be the more effective measure to deal with churning players.},

  @article{Khan2015,
 abstract = {Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of firms in many different industries. As    these firms collect an increasing amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting churn. In this paper, we    present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a "Churn Score" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual      will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before        feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large mobile phone network, our method identifies several intuitive - and a few  surprising - early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4{\%} accuracy.},
