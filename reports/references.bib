 abstract = {Predictive business process monitoring methods exploit logs of completed cases of a process in order to make predictions about running cases thereof. Existing methods in this space are  tailor-made for specific prediction tasks. Moreover, their relative accuracy is highly sensitive to the dataset at hand, thus requiring users to engage in trial-and-error and tuning when applying   them in a specific setting. This paper investigates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as an approach to build consistently accurate models for a wide range of predictive process         monitoring tasks. First, we show that LSTMs outperform existing techniques to predict the next event of a running case and its timestamp. Next, we show how to use models for predicting the next     task in order to predict the full continuation of a running case. Finally, we apply the same approach to predict the remaining time, and show that this approach outperforms existing tailor-made     methods.},

 abstract = {Predicting when players will leave a game creates a unique opportunity to increase players' lifetime and revenue contribution. Players can be incentivized to stay, strategically cross-  linked to other games in the company's portfolio or, as a last resort, be passed on to other companies through in-game advertisement. This paper focuses on predicting churn for highvalue players    of casual social games and attempts to assess the business impact that can be derived from a predictive churn model. We compare the prediction performance of four common classification algorithms   over two casual social games, each with millions of players. Furthermore, we implement a hidden Markov model to explicitly address temporal dynamics. We find that a neural network achieves the      best prediction performance in terms of area under curve (AUC). In addition, to assess the business value of churn prediction, we design and implement an A/B test on one of the games, using free    in-game currency as an incentive to retain players. Test results indicate that contacting players shortly before the predicted churn event substantially improves the effectiveness of communication  with players. They further show that giving out free in-game currency does not significantly impact the churn rate or monetization of players. This suggests that players can only be retained by     remarkably changing their gameplay experience ahead of the churn event and that cross-linking may be the more effective measure to deal with churning players.},

 abstract = {Churn prediction, or the task of identifying customers who are likely to discontinue use of a service, is an important and lucrative concern of firms in many different industries. As    these firms collect an increasing amount of large-scale, heterogeneous data on the characteristics and behaviors of customers, new methods become possible for predicting churn. In this paper, we    present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a "Churn Score" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual      will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before        feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms. Using several terabytes of data from a large mobile phone network, our method identifies several intuitive - and a few  surprising - early warning signs of churn, and our best model predicts whether a subscriber will churn with 89.4{\%} accuracy.},

 @article{Burez2009,
 abstract = {Customer churn is often a rare event in service industries, but of great interest and great value. Until recently, however, class imbalance has not received much attention in the        context of data mining [Weiss, G. M. (2004). Mining with rarity: A unifying framework. SIGKDD Explorations, 6(1), 7-19]. In this study, we investigate how we can better handle class imbalance in    churn prediction. Using more appropriate evaluation metrics (AUC, lift), we investigated the increase in performance of sampling (both random and advanced under-sampling) and two specific           modelling techniques (gradient boosting and weighted random forests) compared to some standard modelling techniques. AUC and lift prove to be good evaluation metrics. AUC does not depend on a       threshold, and is therefore a better overall evaluation metric compared to accuracy. Lift is very much related to accuracy, but has the advantage of being well used in marketing practice [Ling,     C., {\&} Li, C. (1998). Data mining for direct marketing problems and solutions. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD-98). New York,     NY: AAAI Press]. Results show that under-sampling can lead to improved prediction accuracy, especially when evaluated with AUC. Unlike Ling and Li [Ling, C., {\&} Li, C. (1998). Data mining for     direct marketing problems and solutions. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD-98). New York, NY: AAAI Press], we find that there is no   need to under-sample so that there are as many churners in your training set as non churners. Results show no increase in predictive performance when using the advanced sampling technique CUBE in   this study. This is in line with findings of Japkowicz [Japkowicz, N. (2000). The class imbalance problem: significance and strategies. In Proceedings of the 2000 international conference on        artificial intelligence (IC-AI'2000): Special track on inductive learning, Las Vegas, Nevada], who noted that using sophisticated sampling techniques did not give any clear advantage. Weighted      random forests, as a cost-sensitive learner, performs significantly better compared to random forests, and is therefore advised. It should, however always be compared to logistic regression.        Boosting is a very robust classifier, but never outperforms any other technique. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ballings2012,
 abstract = {The key question of this study is: How long should customer event history be for customer churn prediction? While most studies in predictive churn modeling aim to improve models by      data augmentation or algorithm improvement, this study focuses on a another dimension: time window optimization with respect to predictive performance. This paper first presents a formalization of  the time window selection strategy, along with a literature review. Next, using logistic regression, classification trees and bagging in combination with classification trees, this study analyzes   the improvement in churn-model performance by extending customer event history from one to sixteen years. The results show that, after the fifth additional year, predictive performance is only      marginally increased, meaning that the company in this study can discard 69{\%} of its data with almost no decrease in predictive performance. The practical implication is that analysts can         substantially decrease data-related burdens, such as data storage, preparation and analysis. This is particularly valuable in times of big data when decreasing computational complexity is           paramount. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of churn prediction in Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) from a social science perspective and develop models           incorporating theories of player motivation. The ability to predict player churn can be a valuable resource to game developers designing customer retention strategies. The results from our theory-  driven model significantly outperform a diffusion-based churn prediction model on the same dataset. We describe the synthesis between a theory-driven approach and a data-driven approach to a        problem and examine the trade-offs involved between the two approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability and model complexity. We observe that even though the theory-driven model    is not as accurate as the data-driven one, the theory-driven model itself can be more interpretable to the domain experts and hence, more preferable over a complex data-driven model. We perform     lift analysis of the two models and find that if a marketing effort is restricted in the number of customers it can contact, the theory-driven model would offer much better return-on-investment by  identifying more customers among that restricted set who have the highest probability of churn. Finally, we use a clustering technique to partition the dataset and then build an ensemble on the     partitioned dataset for better performance. Experiment results show that the ensemble performs notably better than the single classifier in terms of its recall value, which is a highly desirable    property in the churn prediction problem.},

 abstract = {Customer churn prediction literature has been limited to modeling churn in the next (feasible) time period. On the other hand, lead time specific churn predictions can help businesses   to allocate retention efforts across time, as well as customers, and identify early triggers and indicators of customer churn. We propose a dynamic churn prediction framework for generating         training data from customer records, and leverage it for predicting customer churn within multiple horizons using standard classifiers. Further, we empirically evaluate the proposed approach in a   case study about private banking customers in a European bank. The proposed framework includes customer observations from different time periods, and thus addresses the absolute rarity issue that   is relevant for the most valuable customer segment of many companies. It also increases the sampling density in the training data and allows the models to generalize across behaviors in different   time periods while incorporating the impact of the environmental drivers. As a result, this framework significantly increases the prediction accuracy across prediction horizons compared to the      standard approach of one observation per customer; even when the standard approach is modified with oversampling to balance the data, or lags of customer behavior features are added as additional   predictors. The proposed approach to dynamic churn prediction involves a set of independently trained horizon-specific binary classifiers that use the proposed dataset generation framework. In the  absence of predictive dynamic churn models, we had to benchmark survival analysis which is used predominantly as a descriptive tool. The proposed method outperforms survival analysis in terms of    predictive accuracy for all lead times, with a much lower variability. Further, unlike Cox regression, it provides horizon specific ranking of customers in terms of churn probability which allows   allocation of retention efforts across customers and time periods. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Available : Auon Retrieved : 30 Abstract Consumer brands often run promotional campaigns and offer discounts / coupons to attract new customers . To    increase the loyal customer base and enhance re - turn on investment (ROI) , it is important for consumer brands to identify the customers who are more likely to return for repeat purchase (s)      after availing an offer . The basket - level transaction history is typically used to predict the repeat - purchase behavior of customers . Different aspects of a customer ' s behavior can be       captured using aggregate information (e . g . , total number of purchases made over last one year) and temporal information (e . g . , time - series of daily or weekly purchases) . Most existing    models either use aggregate level features only or inde - pendent window - based features without considering the sequence of transactions . We propose that a prediction model based on a            combination of temporal and ag - gregate level models performs better compared to individual models . We use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) as a classifier over temporal features as time - series    and quantile regression (QR) as a classifier over aggregate level features . QR focuses on capturing aggregate level aspects while LSTM focuses on capturing temporal aspects of behavior for         predicting repeating tendencies . The two models are then combined using a mixture of experts (ME) . Experiments on a real - world Kaggle dataset demonstrate significant improvement in performance  in terms of mean squared error (MSE) on using ME . Additionally , we demonstrate that the DFT coefficients of the time - series for repeaters and non - repeaters lie in separate low - dimensional   embeddings indicating that there is a prominent discriminative signal in the temporal data .},
